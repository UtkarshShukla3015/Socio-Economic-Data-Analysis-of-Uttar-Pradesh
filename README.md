# Socio-Economic Data Analysis of Uttar Pradesh
This project focuses on analyzing the socio-economic conditions of Uttar Pradesh by creating a structured dataset from scratch. The dataset includes key indicators such as literacy rates, income levels, employment 
status, and regional disparities. Tools like Excel and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) were used for data collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
The project is designed as a foundation for future predictive modeling. As more real-world data is collected, machine learning techniques will be applied to forecast socio-economic trends and assist in policy-making 
insights.

**IN SHORT**

# Socio-Economic Data Analysis of Uttar Pradesh
This project focuses on analyzing the socio-economic landscape of **Uttar Pradesh** by **creating a comprehensive dataset from scratch**. The dataset includes key indicators such as:

- Literacy rates  
- Income levels  
- Employment statistics  
- Regional disparities  

### Tools & Technologies Used
